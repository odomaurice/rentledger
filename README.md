# RentLedger

A modern rent management platform built with Next.js and MongoDB that helps landlords track properties, tenants, and payments while giving tenants clear visibility into their rent status.

## About RentLedger

RentLedger simplifies rent management by replacing manual tracking (notebooks, WhatsApp chats, Excel sheets) with structured dashboards and automated payment tracking.

**Problem Solved:**
- Landlords forget who has paid
- Tenants forget due dates
- No clear record of outstanding balances
- Manual tracking causes conflicts and stress

**Solution:**
- Automated rent payment monitoring
- Clear dashboards showing who paid and who hasn't
- Overdue payment tracking
- Role-based access for landlords and tenants

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js API routes + Mongoose
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment:** Vercel
